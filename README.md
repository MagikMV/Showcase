# Showcase
This repository contains most of my coding work done in college as both a tutor and a student, as well as documentation for my qualifications
## Works
All directories/files have been renamed to contain spaces for readability and navigation (as I would assume these are all retired from command line interfaces)
* Note: The works contained under "CS445 Compiler Design" have improper indentation and formatting (specifically all directories after hw2) due to the text editor I used at the time (GNU nano). It is unfortunate as it is my most comprehensive/substantial project. It being thousands of lines to sift through, it regrettably became too time consuming to restore and I no longer have access to the original files. All the code contained within worked and served their purpose, it just remains a bit unreadable, but that is not for a lack of coding standards or style. Hopefully the essence can still be conveyed and hopefully my other works can inform of my coding practices
## Qualifications
As a supplement to my resume, I have included the official documents that prove my qualifications
1. My Bachelor's Degree
2. My Official Transcript
3. My Teaching English as a Second Language Certificate
4. A CompTIA ITF+ Certicate I obtained while working as an Internet Support Technician
